Update jnbinder when the next SoS is released:
- add new options to `config.yml` and comment them out
- change this line in README: an index with filename _index.ipynb will automatically be generated, and rendered as _index.html.
- remove this line in README: The release.sos script will not automatically remove webpages that are no longer needed (e.g., after renaming a Jupyter notebook). You will need to delete these unused files manually.
