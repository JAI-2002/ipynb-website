# Simple data science website using Jupyter notebooks

This repository is an adaptable template for publishing websites from
[Jupyter interactive notebooks](https://jupyter.org).

*Please clone and adapt this repository for your own project.*

View the demo project website
[here](https://stephenslab.github.io/ipynb-website).

This website template is based on
[jnbinder](https://github.com/gaow/jnbinder).

If you find any problems, or would like to suggest new features,
please open an
[Issue](https://github.com/stephenslab/ipynb-website/issues). We also
encourage community contributions, e.g., by forking the repository,
making your suggested changes, and issuing a pull request.

## Quick Start

To start your own Jupyter-notebook-based research website, please
follow these steps. *Note:* These instructions assume that you are
managing your project files inside a git repository, but this is not
strictly necessary; if you prefer not to do this, simply skip the git
commands in the steps below. (For a quick introduction to git, see
[here](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice) or
[here](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004668 ).)

1. Install Python >= 3.5 and Jupyter. The recommended way to do this
is to download and install
[Anaconda 3](https://www.continuum.io/anaconda-overview). Note that
Python >= 3.5 comes with [pip](https://pip.pypa.io).

2. *Note of caution:* If you already have Jupyter installed for
Python 2.x (e.g., Anaconda 2), then you will need to be careful that
you install SoS for Python 3.x in the next step. To make sure, before
running the commands below, run `pip --version`.)

3. Install [SoS](https://github.com/vatlab/SOS) ("Script of Scripts")
for Python 3.x:

   ```bash
   pip install sos
   ```

   Note that you may need to include the `--user` flag if you do not
   have administrative privileges on the computer.

4. [Download](https://github.com/stephenslab/ipynb-website/archive/master.zip),
or clone the latest version of this repository from Github.

5. Install [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads). 

6. Create a new git repository (`git init ...`), copy all the files
from this repository to the new repository folder, then add these
files to the new repository (using `git add ...` and `git commit
-a`). Alternatively, create a new folder (`mkdir ...`) and add copy
the files to this new folder.

7. Inside your new project directory, re-generate all the webpages
using the SoS release script:

   ```bash
   sos-runner ./release -s force
   ```

   All the webpages are created and stored in the "docs"
   directory. This is particularly convenient for git repositories on
   Github because 
   [Github Pages](https://help.github.com/categories/github-pages-basics)
   can be configured to publish the webpages from the "docs" folder.

8. View the newly generated home page `docs/index.html` in your
favorite Web browser.

9. You are now ready to adapt the Jupyter-notebook-based website for
   your own project:

   + Modify the website settings by editing `config.yml`. See the
     comments in this file for more detailed instructions.

   + Copy, rename or delete the notebooks in the "analysis", "setup"
     and "license" directories.

   + Edit the notebooks interactively in Jupyter.

   + After you are satisfied with your changes, re-build the modified
     webpages by running `sos-runner release`, or use `sos-runner
     release -s force` to re-build all the webpages, then commit your
     changes to the git repository.

   + Push your changes (`git remote add ...` and `git push ...`) to
     your favourite git hosting website ([Github](http://github.com),
     [GitLab](http://gitlab.com), [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org),
     *etc.*), and configure the repository settings to publish the
     webpages (e.g., using
     [Github Pages](https://help.github.com/categories/github-pages-basics)).

## More setup details

+ Whenever you make global changes to the website (e.g., you change
  the Boostrap theme in `config.yml`), use the `-s force` option to force
  updates to all the webpages.

+ The [jnbinder](https://github.com/gaow/jnbinder) tool is used to
  generate the webpages from the Jupyter notebooks. To retrieve the
  most up-to-date version of jnbinder for your project, run this
  command in the main directory of your repository:

  ```bash
  sos-runner ./release.sos upgrade-jnbinder
  ```

## Tips for adapting this repository for your project

+ The `release` script will not automatically remove webpages that are
no longer needed (e.g., after renaming a Jupyter notebook); you will
need to delete them manually.

+ Not all Bootstrap themes are currently supported. So far, we have
only implemented the Cerulean, Flatly and Readable themes. Go
[here](https://bootswatch.com) to previous the supported Bootstrap
themes. Note that there still may be style conflicts or
inconsistencies in the CSS files; please report these style conflicts
by posting an
[Issue](https://github.com/stephenslab/ipynb-website/issues).
